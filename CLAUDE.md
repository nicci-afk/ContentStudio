# ContentStudio — project brain

Standalone AI-visibility content engine: Node/Express API + vanilla ES-module
frontend, no build step. Deployed on Render (service `contentstudio`,
`contentstudio-zc9j.onrender.com`) from branch
`claude/content-studio-ai-visibility-shlgxc`. **Every push auto-deploys and
restarts the server, which kills in-flight video renders** — batch changes and
push only when the user is not rendering.

## Architecture

- `server.js` — all routes: state/workspaces/media/generate (job-based)/
  packages/render/voice/avatar/auth/llms.txt
- `lib/store.js` — per-workspace JSON stores (`data/workspaces/<id>/`),
  rolling state snapshots, media file storage
- `lib/engine.js` — generation doctrine (17 laws), master context,
  per-platform generation, FAQ/citation layer, media AI selection, brief and
  voice-DNA synthesis
- `lib/platforms.js` — 14 platform specs (fields drive prompts, UI, rubric)
- `lib/visibility.js` — E-E-A-T-V rubric, schema.org JSON-LD, llms.txt
- `lib/providers.js` — Claude / ElevenLabs / HeyGen clients; list calls are
  cached 10 min with stale-on-failure + one retry
- `lib/render.js` — Auto-Produce: chunked ffmpeg slideshow (memory-bounded),
  word-timed burned captions (ElevenLabs timestamps), HeyGen avatar open,
  narration cache (per voice+script hash), render job state persisted to disk
- `lib/auth.js` — magic-link email sign-in (MAGIC_EMAILS allowlist) +
  password sessions + Basic auth for API tools
- `public/js/` — one module per view; `el()` helper in `ui.js`

## Non-negotiable content rules

1. Never use em dashes or en dashes in any generated copy, example text, or
   user-facing content (doctrine law 9).
2. Respect `profile.business.neverMention` (per-workspace hard blocklist,
   enforced in generation context and scored by the rubric). Never name
   blocklisted entities anywhere — including docs, commits, and chat drafts.
3. Voice DNA uploads are additive (same filename replaces that file only).
4. Interview hints adapt to declared industry; all questions optional.
5. Industry respect (doctrine law 17): never say anything negative about any
   supplier, resort, hotel, cruise line, airline, tour operator, venue, or
   destination. This applies everywhere: generated content, docs, commits,
   and chat drafts. Negative source material is omitted or recast as a
   neutral, unnamed lesson. The creator is a travel industry professional;
   neutral or positive framing only.

## Working conventions

- Test locally first: `PORT=4616 node server.js`, curl the API, drive the UI
  with Playwright (`executablePath: '/opt/pw-browsers/chromium'`). Then push.
- `data/` is gitignored; production data lives on the Render disk at
  `/var/data` (CONTENTSTUDIO_DATA). State snapshots exist for recovery.
- Keys live only in Render env vars (.env locally). Never in the repo.

## Current state (2026-07-19)

Everything core is live: interview + story brief, additive voice DNA, media
library (parallel import, HEIC/video EXIF+GPS, AI analysis, AI selection),
pillars/series with cadence parsing and undo, 14-platform generation with the
GEO citation layer (definition, query map, cite lines), visibility rubric with
blocklist check, in-place field editing, Website Kit (Lovable prompt export),
per-platform tracked CTA links, Auto-Produce video rendering, magic-link auth,
multi-workspace, snapshots.

**Memory: resolved.** The instance is upgraded to Standard 2GB and a
long-form Auto-Produce render completed end to end on it (2026-07-20).
Narration stays cached per voice+script hash, so retries are free.

**Deployed 2026-07-20:** blur-fill slide layout (whole image visible over
a blurred fill, both orientations); original video upload at import
(streamed, 500MB cap) with re-import attaching footage to existing
"frame only" items; real muted video clips cut into Auto-Produce b-roll
(looped to slot, poster-frame fallback); HeyGen photo avatars
(talking_photos) listed and rendered with kind-aware payloads everywhere;
persistent avatar-list errors with retry in Avatar Studio; doctrine law
17. HeyGen API credits are loaded (a HeyGen 402 insufficient_credit was
the earlier avatar block; resolved by the user).

Active user workspace: "Conscious Creator" (application-launch campaign for a
Feb 8-12 Akumal & Tulum retreat; pillars/series architecture documented in
conversation and entered by the user). The launch package id is
0d5825c2e277bfec (the pkg param on the Create view URL).

**Deployed 2026-07-20, second push:** render details line shows the real
clip count ("N real clips"); storage maintenance endpoints: GET
/api/storage (disk totals plus per-workspace media/footage/renders/temp
breakdown), POST /api/storage/cleanup (removes render temp folders no
running job owns, plus partial uploads older than 10 minutes), POST
/api/storage/renders/delete with {workspaceId, renderId}; a boot sweep
deletes orphaned render temp folders at startup (logs "storage: swept
..."); startRender refuses with a clear message when the data disk has
under 1536MB free.

**Launch handoff (2026-07-20).** The user re-imported footage, then the
first long-form Auto-Produce attempt failed with ENOSPC: the data disk
filled (footage originals plus orphaned render temp folders from earlier
interrupted renders). The storage tools above shipped in response; their
boot sweep freed the orphaned temp space automatically at deploy. That
session's egress allowlist blocked contentstudio-zc9j.onrender.com; the
user added the domain to the environment allowlist, which applies to
sessions started after the change. Pickup order:
1. Sign in to production from the session: POST /auth/magic/request with
   {"email":"nicci@travelghr.com"}, read the one-time link from the
   user's connected Gmail (subject "Your ContentStudio sign-in link",
   expires in 15 minutes), GET it with a cookie jar; the cs_session
   cookie lasts 30 days. Always confirm with the user before any push to
   the deploy branch; every push restarts the server and kills renders
   and uploads in flight.
2. GET /api/storage: want 4-5GB free before the long-form render. POST
   /api/storage/cleanup, and with the user's OK delete old renders via
   /api/storage/renders/delete. If still tight, the user expands the
   disk in the Render dashboard (disks only grow; resizing restarts the
   service).
3. GET /api/media: every video item must show hasOriginal true. Any
   still false likely failed during the disk-full window; the user
   re-imports just those files (attach matches exact file name + size).
4. Produce the long-form YouTube video: UI Create view, or POST
   /api/render with packageId, platformId "youtube_long", orientation
   "landscape", the user's cloned ElevenLabs voice ("Nicci · your
   clone"), avatar open enabled (avatar "Cynthia Grotefendt", HeyGen
   voice "Smalls - Voice 1"). Poll GET /api/render/:id (10-20 min);
   verify the finished meta shows videoClips > 0, captions true, avatar
   true, and spot-check the MP4 (blur-fill layout, burned captions).
5. Then: fill the [FILL] facts via the Edit buttons across the package,
   re-check the visibility score, then day-one publishing (YouTube +
   Website Kit into Lovable + LinkedIn same day, then socials per the
   rhythm grid).

## Agreed roadmap (in order)

1. **Brand Kit** — persistent visual identity (colors, fonts, thumbnail
   style) feeding thumbnail concepts and caption styling in renders
2. **Clustering research** — Claude web-search pass that studies top
   creators/ads for a topic and emits a packaging brief before generation
3. **YouTube retention analyzer** — read audience-retention graphs, flag
   drop-offs, suggest fixes per episode
4. **Multi-tenant SaaS phase** — accounts, encrypted per-user provider keys,
   Postgres, billing (only after the content engine is validated)

## Docs

- `README.md` — setup, full API reference, deploy, auth
- `docs/AI-VISIBILITY-PLAYBOOK.md` — the methodology (E-E-A-T-V, platform
  weighting, capture doctrine, retention loop)
